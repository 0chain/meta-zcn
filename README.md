# meta-zcn

The [**Yocto Project**](https://www.yoctoproject.org/) is an open source collaboration project that helps developers create custom Linux-based systems regardless of the hardware architecture. Meanwhile, [**OpenEmbedded**](http://www.openembedded.org/wiki/Main_Page) is a build automation framework and cross-compile environment used to create Linux distributions for embedded devices.

Together, these projects provides a flexible set of tools and a space where embedded developers worldwide can share technologies, software stacks, configurations, and best practices that can be used to create tailored Linux images for embedded and IoT devices, or anywhere a customized Linux OS is needed.

The **meta-zcn** OpenEmbedded Layer aims to provide recipes for 0chain related apps, tools and libraries in order to support the 0chain blockchain on a large variety of embedded devices.
