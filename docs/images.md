## zcn-image-base

`zcn-image-base` is a basic prototype image. It includes:
- `zboxcli`
- `zwalletcli`
- `git`
- `jq`
- `nano`
- `vim`
- `go`
- `go-runtime`
- `python3`
- `python3-dev`
- `python3-pip`
- `python3-setuptools`

`root` user with empty password is allowed. This needs to be changed for production images.
