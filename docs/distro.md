# Distro

`conf/distro/zcn.conf` defines the `zcn` [`DISTRO`](https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/current/mega-manual/mega-manual.html#var-DISTRO) variable.

It is a derivative of [Poky](https://www.yoctoproject.org/software-item/poky/), which is the reference distribution from the Yocto Project.

The `zcn` distribution provides the following features:
- `systemd` as service and networking manager.
- `docker` as virtualization manager.
- `opkg`as package manager.

# Images

## zcn-image-base

`zcn-image-base` is a basic prototype image. It includes:
- `zboxcli`
- `zwalletcli`
- `git`
- `jq`
- `nano`
- `vim`
- `go`
- `go-runtime`
- `python3`
- `python3-dev`
- `python3-pip`
- `python3-setuptools`

`root` user with empty password is allowed. This needs to be changed for production images.
